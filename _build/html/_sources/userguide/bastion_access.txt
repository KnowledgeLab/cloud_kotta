Bastion Access
==============

Generating SSH keys:
--------------------

Generate an SSH key following this document :
https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/
Please note the following:
1.  Do *NOT* send me your private key
2.  Please send public key as an attachment rather than pasting it's contents

Creating a user on Bastion:
---------------------------
Once you have an ssh public key, either mail it to "yadu@uchicago.edu" as an attachment or
send it to @yadu on Channel:#cloudkotta under the KnowledgeLab organization.

Logging in:
-----------

.. code-block:: bash
   :linenos: 

   ssh <username>@bastion.turingcompute.net
