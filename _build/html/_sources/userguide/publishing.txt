How to Publish a job
--------------------

Select a particular job that you would like to publish. On the page you should be seeing
3 buttons that say **Cancel Job**, **Redo Job**, **Publish Job**.

Clicking the **Publish Job** takes you to the Publish page. Here you are required to fill out
a meaningful name for the job and a short job description. At the minimum your job description must cover the following:

1. What does the job do ?
2. Is it CPU/RAM/IO intensive
3. If it is not multi-threaded/multi-processing note that.
4. If your code accesses protected data sets, note that as a requirement.
5. Describe each input file and expected format.
6. Describe each output file and expected format.
